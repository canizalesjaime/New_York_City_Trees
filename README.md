# New_York_City_Trees

The csv file included is 2015 street tree census from NYC open data website.
File was modified by reducing the total number of features to those of interest.

The program represents each instance from the data file(a tree) and its features as a node in an avl tree.
The user inputs a query and if the query matches a tree species or a sub-word of a tree species the program returns all tree species
that contain matches and their occurrences in each borough.
